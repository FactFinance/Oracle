# Security Backlog

## Input Validation:
Ensure that all input parameters are properly validated to prevent unexpected behavior or attacks. For example, when adding a subscription, consider checking if the provided address is a valid public key.

## Permission Checks:
Double-check permission checks to ensure that only authorized users can perform sensitive actions. For instance, in the `set_auditor` function, verify that the caller is indeed the owner of the data feed before setting the auditor.

## Data Encapsulation:
Encapsulate sensitive data within the program and expose only the necessary functionality through program instructions. This prevents unauthorized external access to critical data.

## Error Handling:
Implement robust error handling mechanisms to gracefully handle unexpected conditions and prevent potential exploits. Ensure that error messages do not leak sensitive information.

## Access Control Lists (ACLs):
Implement Access Control Lists to manage permissions for different actions and resources within the program. This allows for more granular control over who can perform specific operations.

## Audit Trails:
Maintain logs or audit trails of important actions performed within the program to facilitate debugging, monitoring, and forensic analysis.

# Optimization Backlog

## Minimize Storage:
Reduce the amount of data stored in accounts to minimize storage costs. Optimize the layout of account structures and store only essential data. For example, consider using compact data representations or encoding schemes where appropriate.

## Batch Processing:
Group similar operations together and execute them in batches to reduce the number of transactions and associated costs. For example, if you have multiple subscriptions to add or revoke, batch them together instead of processing each one individually.

## Caching:
Implement caching mechanisms to reduce the frequency of reads from on-chain data. Cache frequently accessed data locally within the program or off-chain to minimize the number of on-chain interactions.

## Optimized Instructions:
Ensure that your program instructions are optimized for efficiency. Minimize unnecessary computations, loops, or redundant checks to reduce execution time and associated costs.

## Gas Usage:
Monitor and analyze gas usage of your program instructions using Solana's tools and metrics. Identify areas where gas consumption can be optimized, such as reducing instruction complexity or optimizing storage access patterns.

## Off-Chain Processing:
Offload non-critical or computationally intensive tasks to off-chain services where feasible. Perform pre-processing, data aggregation, or complex computations off-chain to reduce on-chain execution costs.

## Event-Driven Architecture:
Design your program to be event-driven, where possible, to minimize idle waiting and maximize resource utilization. Use Solana's event system to trigger actions based on external events or state changes.

## Code Reviews and Profiling:
Conduct regular code reviews and profiling to identify performance bottlenecks and areas for optimization. Use tools like Solana's profiler to analyze program execution and identify hotspots for optimization.
